# SalesTaxes
My code for the assignment.
There is a console application in the project SalesTaxes with the 3 input cases.
Or, there is an acceptance test in the project SalesTaxes.Tests.

A brief not about the design:
- Input is parsed (using Regular Expression) and a list of categorized products is returned.
- Then, taxes are calculated, using a TaxCalculator
- Finally, a ProductPrinter prints the receipt.

Enjoy :-)
